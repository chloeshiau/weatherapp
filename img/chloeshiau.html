<div id = "regentmsg">
  Welcome to the website of Theta Tau, Omicron Gamma Chapter! We take pride in being the only co-ed professional engineering fraternity at UC Davis, as well as the first engineering fraternity of the nation. We consistently strive to prepare ourselves for a better future, to create events for the good of the entire student body, and to strengthen the bonds within our organization - through our three pillars of professionalism, community service and brotherhood.
<br><br>
  I am so grateful to be a part of this chapter of Theta Tau. Beyond the fraternityâ€™s values, it is the people who challenge me to go beyond my comfort zone and take on the responsibilities that I do. Every day, I am motivated by all the selfless, hard work our Brothers put in to make us a more tightly-knit and progressive organization. I wholeheartedly owe the person I am today and the memorable experiences I have gained, to all the Brothers of this fraternity. If you are looking for a fulfilling college experience to help build a strong foundation for your future - be it through establishing your professional, social, or service skills - I urge you to come check out Theta Tau and become inspired not only by its values, but also its Brothers, as I have been.
